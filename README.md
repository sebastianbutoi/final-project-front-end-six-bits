# SalVeg

This repo contains the front end for SalVeg - a web application created by Team Six Bits for our final 4 week project at the School of Code!

## Description

We were given a very open-ended brief - to solve a problem. <br></br>
With this in mind, we decided to put our efforts towards solving the problem of food waste.

## Our Problem Statement

> Of all fresh food that's produced, roughly a third of it is wasted, from farms and home growers. Despite supermarkets high cosmetic standards, a significant amount of consumers are prepared to buy wonky or otherwise edible vegetables, but there is no easy way to communicate with producers.

## Our Solution

We created an app that works as a platform to connect people who have excess fresh produce (whether this is farmers or home growers) to people who are happy to buy vegetables directly from producers even if they don't meet the standards held by supermarkets.
