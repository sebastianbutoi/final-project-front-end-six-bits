# SalVeg

This repo contains the **Front-End** for SalVeg. 

SalVeg is a web application created by Team Six Bits for the final 4 week project at the School of Code (Nov 2021 - Mar 2022).

## Description

We were given a very open-ended brief - to solve a problem.

With this in mind, we decided to put our efforts towards solving the problem of food waste.

## Our Problem Statement

> Of all fresh food that's produced, roughly a third of it is wasted.
Despite supermarkets' high cosmetic standards, a consumers are prepared to buy wonky or otherwise edible vegetables, but there is no easy way to communicate between producers and consumers.

## Our Solution

We created an app that works as a platform to connect people who have excess fresh produce (whether this is farmers or home growers) to people who are happy to buy vegetables directly from producers even if they don't meet the standards held by supermarkets.
